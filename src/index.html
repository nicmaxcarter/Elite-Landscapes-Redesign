          Elite Landscapes was established full time in 2013 by Grayson Smith
          after graduating from Lowndes High. He took his passion for being
          outside and working hard and made it into a career. From the humble
          beginnings of a young dream, the company has now effectn into much
          more including: Landscape installation, Landscape Lighting, turf and
          ornamental care, paver installation, full service lawn maintenance,
          irrigation, and drainage. A true vision for creating and maintaining
          beautiful landscapes paired with a high priority on customer service
          is what sets Elite Landscapes apart from the rest.
